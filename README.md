- list columns and their meaning
- Lastly, to validate this data reference was made to an article by [Data Bridge Market Research](https://www.databridgemarketresearch.com/reports/global-used-car-market)

### Data Preparation
The data was checked for missing values and some columns were found to have null values.The null values were handled by dropping all the rows with them.
Some columns were not in their appropriate data type so this was corrected to create a cleaner and easier to work with dataframe.
We also had duplicates in the data which we dropped.
